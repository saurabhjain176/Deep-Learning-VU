# Implementing MLP using Numpy from scratch

## Goal: 
1. Implement MLP (aka fully-connected neural network) and its learning algorithm (stochastic gradient descent) in Numpy and train it on MNIST dataset ((use load_mnist(...) from Data.py to get data)).
2. Implement scalar backpropagation using plain python and the math package.
3. Implement following network architecture and train the network on the synthetic data (use load_synth(...) from Data.py to get data):
